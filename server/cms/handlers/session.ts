/**
 * Session cookie helpers and constant-time login dummy hash.
 *
 * Two concerns colocated because both are about the login/session boundary:
 *
 *  - `sessionCookie` / `clearSessionCookie` build the `Set-Cookie` headers
 *    used by the auth handlers. They detect HTTPS via `X-Forwarded-Proto`
 *    (so the `Secure` flag is set when behind a reverse proxy) and fall
 *    back to the request URL otherwise.
 *
 *  - `getDummyPasswordHash` returns a fixed argon2id hash, computed once
 *    per process. The login handler verifies against it on the
 *    "no such user" branch so latency stays constant and an attacker
 *    can't enumerate emails by timing.

 *
 * Spoofing X-Forwarded-Proto from a direct (non-proxied) HTTP client doesn't
 * gain the attacker anything: it would cause the server to set `Secure`,
 * which makes browsers refuse to send the cookie over HTTP. So the worst
